        <h5>Summary</h5>
        <p>I'm a UI and UX designer with experience in end-to-end digital product design, from research to branding, mockups to front-end coding. Projects that excite me the most involve distilling information into slick visuals and pleasing micro-interactions. </p>

          <h2>The backstory</h2>
          <h5>I grew up in Alaska, on an island, in a town wrapped in mossy rainforest on one side and ocean on the other.</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="content bio-para-1">
          <p>As a kid, I spent free time poking at anemones and catching tiny fish in tidepools. I watched the sea lions tousle and humpback whales spout offshore.</p>
          <p>At the same time, I loved art. When the Tempera paints came out, I created blobby, smiling sea creatures. When I wasn't at the beach, I meticulously filled in ever more complicated coloring books.</p>
        </div>
        <blockquote>My mind was geared to be a designer, but at the time I didn’t see it as a valid career path.</blockquote>
        <div class="content">
          <p>So, I followed my other passion and studied ocean resource management. College and graduate school were rich with natural and social sciences, I had a stint on Capitol hill, and for five years I was a consultant at a small firm, helping
            conservation groups set strong strategies.</p>
          <p>This all made sense on the surface - after all, the natural environment, and especially the ocean, is important to me and I was helping conserve it.</p>
        </div>
        <blockquote>My career in conservation just didn’t feel right.</blockquote>

          <h2>The undercurrent</h2>
          <h5>Over the years, the reality bubbled up.</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="content bio-para-1">
          <p>While I love the natural environment, I don’t love the work of a traditional environmental professional.</p>
        </div>
        <blockquote>In the office and classroom, what I enjoyed most was problem-solving the best way to convey information visually.</blockquote>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Here’s what was happening under the surface:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-3-flex">
          <div class="bio-list">
            <p><span class="bold">At college</span> -- Alongside environmental studies, I completed a minor in art. My favorite assignment was to create a series of miniature pencil drawings. Naturally, I drew a collection of sea creatures. I then
              expanded the collection and ran a little business selling prints.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bio-list">
            <p><span class="bold">In graduate school</span> -- For my group master’s thesis, one of my roles was designer of our public-facing work. You could find me up late adjusting colors, creating custom animations, and geeking out whenever I
              landed on a data visualization that clicked.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bio-list">
            <p><span class="bold">As a consultant</span> -- The most exciting thing was figuring out how to display our research findings with graphs, infographics, and writing. (I also managed to design a few company holiday cards along the way.)

        <blockquote>So, I decided to do more of what I like best: design.</blockquote>

          <h2>“Wow that’s a big change - environmental consultant to designer!”</h2>
          <h5>Yes, you could say that. But there’s more crossover than I expected. </h5>
        </div>
        <div class="content bio-para-1">
          <p>Here are a few of the similarities I’ve found:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-3-flex">
          <div>
            <p>Take the <span class="bold">research process</span>. As a consultant, I led numerous online surveys and stakeholder interviews, analyzed the data, and drew out key findings to act on. Sounds pretty familiar to a UX research process,
              right?</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Also, <span class="bold">working with clients</span>. There’s a lot to be said about delivering for clients, whether internal or external to the company. Designers and consultants both do a lot of this.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>And you’ve got to be good at learning on the fly and <span class="bold">working cross-functionally</span>. Consultants and designers wear many hats, from researcher to facilitator to liaison.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <blockquote>In the end, the goal of a consultant and a designer is to find a solution to a problem.</blockquote>
        <div class="content">
          <p>We both package the solution in a way that the target audience can understand and use. Designers just get to have more fun making it look and feel good.</p>
        </div>
        <blockquote>Whether for an environmental cause or not, I want to design experiences that make sense, look good, and convey valuable information.</blockquote>
