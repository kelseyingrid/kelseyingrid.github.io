          <h5>tl;dr</h5>
          <p>I’m a designer who spent much of my career following my first passion - ocean conservation. As a digital product designer, I’ve found that there’s a lot to draw from my time in natural resource science, policy, and consulting.</p>

            <h1>The backstory</h1>
            <h5>I grew up in Alaska, on an island, in a town wrapped in mossy rainforest on one side and the ocean on the other.</h5>
          </div>
          <div class="content bio-para-1">
            <p>As a kid, I spent my free time poking at anemones and catching tiny fish in tidepools. I watched the sea lions tousle and humpback whales spout offshore. I loved art from an early age, and when the Tempera paints came out I created blobby, smiling sea creatures.</p>
          </div>
          <blockquote>It was only natural that I imagined myself in a career where I preserved ocean life.</blockquote>
          <div class="content">
            <p>And I followed that path. College and graduate school were rich with natural and social sciences, I had a stint on Capitol hill, and for five years I was a consultant at a small firm, helping conservation groups set strong strategies.</p>
            <p>This all made sense on the surface - after all, the natural environment, and especially the ocean, is important to me and I was helping conserve it.</p>
          </div>
          <blockquote>It just didn't feel right.</blockquote>

            <h1>The undercurrent</h1>
            <h5>Over the years, the reality bubbled up.</h5>
          </div>
          <div class="content bio-para-1">
            <p>While I love the natural environment, I don’t love the work of a traditional environmentalist.</p>
          </div>
          <blockquote>In the office and classroom, what I enjoyed most was problem-solving the best way to portray information visually.</blockquote>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Here’s what was happening under the surface:</p>
          </div>
            <div class="col-3-flex">
              <div class="bio-list"><p><span class="bold">At college</span> -- Alongside environmental studies, I completed a minor in art. My favorite assignment was to draw a series of miniature pencil drawings. Naturally, I drew a collection of sea creatures. I then expanded the collection and ran a little business selling prints.</p></div>
              <div class="bio-list"><p><span class="bold">In graduate school</span> -- For my group master’s thesis, one of my roles was designer of our public-facing work. You could find me up late adjusting colors, creating custom animations, and geeking out whenever I landed on a data visualization that clicked.</p></div>
              <div class="bio-list"><p><span class="bold">As a consultant</span> -- The most exciting thing was figuring out how to display our research findings with graphs, infographics, and writing. (I also managed to design a few company holiday cards along the way.)</p></div>
            </div>
          <blockquote>So, I decided to do more of what I like best: design.</blockquote>
          <div class="content">
            <p>I quit my job and entered a digital product design program through Bloc.</p>

            <h5>Yes, you could say that. But there’s more crossover than I expected. </h5>
          </div>
          <div class="content bio-para-1">
            <p>Here are a few of the similarities I’ve found:</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-3-flex">
            <div><p>Take the <span class="bold">research process</span>. As a consultant, I led numerous online surveys and stakeholder interviews, analyzed the data, and drew out key findings to act on. Sounds pretty familiar to a designer, right?</p></div>
            <div><p>Also, <span class="bold">working with clients</span>. There’s a lot to be said about delivering for clients, whether the client is internal or external to the company.</p></div>
            <div><p>And you’ve got to be good at learning on the fly and <span class="bold">working cross-functionally</span>. Consultants and designers wear many hats, from researcher to facilitator to liaison.</p></div>
          </div>
          <blockquote>In the end, the goal of a consultant and a designer is to find a solution to a problem.</blockquote>
          <div class="content">
            <p>We both package the solution in a way that the target audience can understand and use. Designers just get to have more fun making it look and feel good.</p>
          </div>
          <blockquote>Whether for an environmental cause or not, I want to design experiences that make sense, look good, and convey valuable information.</blockquote>
